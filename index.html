              <h2>How did he get his name?</h2>
              <p>You may be wondering why I named a guinea pig "Branston".</p>
                <p>In the UK, there's a popular condiment called Branston Pickle — a mixture of diced vegetables pickled in a sauce of vinegar, tomato, apple, and spices.</p>
                <p>I also had another guinea pig named Pickle (who sadly passed away in November 2024), so that's where their names came from.</p>

            <H2>Facts:</H2>
            <ol>
            <li>Another name for hairless guinea pigs is "Skinny Pigs"</li>
            <li>Most are not completely 100% hairless</li>
            <li>For example, Branston has alot of hair on his nose!</li>
            <li>The gene causing hairlessness in skinny guinea pigs is a recessive gene, and breeding two skinny guinea pigs together will always result in all offspring being skinny pigs</li>

        <h2>Here are 5 more differences between guinea pigs and skinny pigs</h2>
        <ol><li>Fur vs. Bare Skin:
        The most obvious difference: traditional guinea pigs have a full coat of fur, while skinny pigs are mostly hairless with just a bit of fuzz on their noses and feet. This makes skinny pigs more prone to feeling cold and requiring warmer living environments.</li>
        <li>Higher Metabolism:
        Skinny pigs have a faster metabolism than their furry cousins because they burn more calories to stay warm. This means they usually eat more food (especially veggies and hay) to maintain their energy and body temperature.</li>
        <li>More Skin Maintenance:
        Without fur to protect them, skinny pigs are more prone to dry skin and skin injuries. They need gentler bedding (like fleece) and sometimes benefit from moisturisers specifically made for small pets—whereas furry guinea pigs usually don’t need such skincare.</li>
        <li>Bathing Needs Differ:
        Furry guinea pigs rarely need baths, and frequent washing can dry out their skin. Skinny pigs, however, might need occasional gentle sponge baths to keep their exposed skin clean, especially in creases and folds.</li>
        <li>Different Origins:
        Skinny pigs were first bred in laboratories in the 1970s for dermatological research. They were later introduced into the pet trade due to their unique look and affectionate personalities. Traditional guinea pigs have been domesticated for thousands of years and were originally kept for food and religious purposes in South America.</li>
